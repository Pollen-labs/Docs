## Intro

In today's interconnected digital landscape, the transfer, publication, and verification of sensitive information face significant challenges. Individuals possessing crucial information often lack secure platforms to share it without risking their privacy or fearing data misuse. This issue extends to journalists who handle sensitive data but struggle to publish without endangering their sources or facing repercussions.

In 2023, we began exploring how to leverage protocols like Semaphore, UniRep, and more to address the pressing issues between whistleblowers and journalists. Through extensive project planning, user interviews, and market research, we conceptualized **Daisy**—a platform aimed at enhancing information transparency while preserving privacy in the journalism space.

## Project Overview

Daisy is an experimental initiative focused on resolving the complexities involved in sharing sensitive information among multiple user groups. Our goal is to empower individuals and journalists to engage in a secure and efficient chain of communication, ultimately fostering a more transparent and trustworthy information ecosystem.

## Who We Are Building For

- **Whistleblowers**: Individuals who have critical information to share but fear exposing their identity.
- **Journalists**: Professionals seeking to publish impactful stories without facing retaliation or censorship.
- **The General Public**: Everyday people who desire access to truthful information that affects their lives, both in significant and subtle ways.
- **Concerned Citizens**: Individuals looking to react to current events but lack a safe and verifiable means to do so.

## Our Assumptions

The lack of trust and security in information sharing is a multifaceted problem. Whistleblowers need secure channels to share sensitive data without compromising their identity. Journalists require platforms that allow them to publish important stories without fear of political, legal, or corporate backlash. Meanwhile, readers are inundated with information and struggle to discern truth from misinformation.

This complex issue intertwines privacy, security, freedom of the press, and the need for factual, unbiased information—a cornerstone of democratic societies. Innovative solutions are essential to bridge these gaps, providing secure platforms for sharing sensitive information and enhancing the credibility of published news.

- **Safe Spaces for Sharing**: People need secure avenues to share sensitive information. Evidence of this need is apparent on platforms like Reddit's [r/Whistleblowers](https://www.reddit.com/r/Whistleblowers/). Organizations like the [Freedom of the Press Foundation](https://freedom.press/) offer tools like [SecureDrop](https://securedrop.org/) to address this.
- **Protection for Journalists**: Journalists need platforms that allow them to publish without fear of retaliation. However, current solutions may not fully address this need.
- **Trustworthy Information for the Public**: The general public requires ways to identify and access trustworthy information amidst the noise of misinformation.

## The Chain of Reaction

We aim to address the entire ecosystem, understanding that each step influences the next. Our focus is on creating a seamless chain of communication from the whistleblower to the journalist and, ultimately, to the public.

Each stage in this chain requires careful consideration and moderation to ensure anonymity and trustworthiness. At the initial stage between the whistleblower and the reporter, critical questions arise:

### Should the Leak Be Publicly Available?

**From a Journalist's Perspective**

If information is publicly accessible rather than sent directly to a reporter, journalists might feel less responsible for acting on it, assuming others will take charge.

**From a Whistleblower's Perspective**

Publicly available leaks may expose whistleblowers, potentially putting them at risk without guaranteeing that the information will lead to justice or be adequately addressed by the media.

## Moderation Challenges

Implementing an effective moderation mechanism is crucial yet challenging. We aim for moderation that is unbiased, self-sustaining, and adaptive. While we have considered utilizing a group of journalists as initial gatekeepers followed by a community council, we recognize that perfecting this aspect is complex.

## Insights from User Interviews

We conducted user interviews with five participants, including three professional journalists, to gain deeper insights. Here are the key themes that emerged:

1. **Reliance on Direct Sourcing and Personal Networks**: Journalists heavily depend on personal relationships to access unique stories, especially in specialized fields like web3.
2. **Verification and Fact-Checking Challenges**: Diminishing resources for fact-checking place greater responsibility on individual journalists, raising concerns about the reliability of published information.
3. **The Critical Role of Editors**: Effective collaboration between writers and editors enhances content quality and integrity, emphasizing the importance of this relationship.
4. **Limited Use of Secure Communication Platforms**: Many journalists are unaware of tools like SecureDrop. While some use encrypted messaging apps like Signal, there's a general gap in adopting specialized platforms for whistleblower interactions.
5. **Depth and Quality Concerns in Web3 Journalism**: Professionals feel that web3 journalism often lacks critical inquiry and depth, possibly due to limited understanding or fears of low engagement.
6. **Importance of Trust and Credibility**: Trust is paramount when dealing with anonymous sources. Journalists emphasize verifying credentials and protecting source identities.
7. **Technology Adoption Gap**: There's a disparity between rapid technological advancements and journalism's understanding and use of these tools, affecting both reporting and journalistic practices.
8. **Reliance on Online Platforms**: Social media plays a significant role in sourcing and publishing, but limitations and risks regarding misinformation and source credibility are acknowledged.

## Conclusion

Our journey with Daisy has been both intriguing and enlightening. The project delves into complex problem spaces that are critical to the integrity of journalism and the dissemination of truthful information. While we are enthusiastic about addressing these challenges, we recognize the potential legal and ethical hurdles, including possible governmental pushback.

Moving forward, we remain committed to finding viable solutions that tackle specific parts of this ecosystem—whether it's enhancing fact-checking processes, improving moderation mechanisms, or combating fake news. We believe these challenges are essential to address for the betterment of society, and we are hopeful about the impact that Daisy can make in fostering a more transparent and trustworthy information landscape.
