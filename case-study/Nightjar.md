## Intro

Nightjar is a zero-knowledge solution built for social movements that dare to challenge the status quo, despite facing opposition from powerful entities. Whether it’s confronting governments, large corporations, or those with the means to sway public opinion, we understand how difficult it can be to create change.

Using anonymous identifiers and provable user data, Nightjar aims to help users stay organized and aligned with their values through a simple, intuitive interface. We believe that every voice deserves to be heard and every cause should be championed.

This project was our first incubation at Pollen Labs and was developed in close collaboration with the UniRep protocol team. Together, we set out to explore this challenge and its potential solutions.

## Our Motivation

Inspired by global events like [labor strikes](https://www.notion.so/7aed9fb89471417aad72c686c6b8c972?pvs=21), the [Canada Convoy protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_convoy_protest), and other significant [social movements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbrella_Movement), we recognized the urgent need for privacy-first solutions. As a team focused on privacy, we wanted to build a platform that empowers activists to act safely while continuing to drive meaningful change.

We sought to understand both individual and union contexts, aiming to design a tool that would truly support workers’ rights and organizational movements.

## Platform Vision

During strikes or protests, there are countless moving parts, and we aim to build a platform that addresses these needs, including:

### Awareness

Often, without the involvement of unions, organizing a protest or movement remains hidden. Groups tend to organize through social media or word of mouth. We believe the platform should feature tools that raise awareness, allowing others to join easily.

### Secure Messaging

While many messaging apps exist, not all are fully encrypted, and users’ identities can be easily compromised. We see secure, anonymous communication as essential for building a comprehensive worker rights tool.

### Joining and Verification

Verifying group members is critical, especially in workplace settings. We envision a seamless join process where, for example, workers can scan a QR code to verify their identity on-site, simplifying the flow while maintaining security.

### Funding

Every movement needs financial support, yet funding is often tied to risk. One key challenge we are addressing is how to enable external supporters to contribute without fear, avoiding situations like the freezing of donors’ bank accounts during the Canada Convoy protests.

### Coordination

A successful movement requires strong coordination. Our platform would feature tools for leaders to organize events, communicate with teams, and manage efforts efficiently.

## User Research

Developing this project has been a complex journey. While we are confident that such a tool would be highly valuable for those we aim to serve, we initially lacked deep integration into active social movements. To bridge this gap, we conducted extensive research.

We reached out to 25+ organizations involved in union movements, though responses were sparse. Fortunately, we connected with [Other Internet](https://otherinter.net/), who were conducting research on Web3 DAO workers. Through these conversations, and interviews with participants, we gathered valuable insights.

## Common Themes and Insights

- **Employer and Organizational Resistance:**
    
    Organizing efforts often face strong opposition from both employers and traditional unions, making change difficult.
    
- **Fragmented Communication Tools:**
    
    The use of multiple, non-integrated platforms creates inefficiencies and increases the workload. Both labor organizations and DAOs need more streamlined communication solutions.
    
- **Desire for Technological Integration:**
    
    There is a strong interest in platforms that combine communication, project management, and governance functionalities. Smart contracts and blockchain are seen as promising for ensuring transparency and accountability.
    
- **Balancing Anonymity and Trust:**
    
    While anonymity is respected, many movements depend on trust, often requiring individuals to reveal their identities. Personal interactions remain essential for building that trust.
    
- **Compensation Challenges:**
    
    Current compensation models, whether in traditional unions or DAOs, often fail to reflect contributors’ efforts accurately, leading to dissatisfaction.
    
- **Community Engagement and Non-Financial Fulfillment:**
    
    Emotional and communal fulfillment are key motivators for participation, with people finding value in being part of a collective that shares their ideals.
    
- **Resistance to Change:**
    
    Larger, more established organizations are often resistant to new tools and technologies, while grassroots movements are more open to innovation.

## Where We Stand

After two months of exploration, we’ve decided to pause and reflect on this project. While we still believe that anonymity can be valuable in certain contexts, our research revealed that participants often prioritize trust over privacy. They want a simple, reliable way to build relationships, even in high-risk situations.

During this journey, we encountered a few interesting applications, even though they don’t focus on anonymity, they serve as useful tools for activists:

•	[Action Network](https://actionnetwork.org/)

•	[Vocal](https://www.govocal.com/)

In conclusion, our exploration of worker rights and social movement tools continues. As we move forward, we remain committed to finding ways to empower those who fight for change, with a focus on security, trust, and community.
