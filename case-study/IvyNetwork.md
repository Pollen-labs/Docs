## Summary
In the spring of 2023, our team were onto a quest to explore innovative ways to boost micro-economies using open, decentralized methodologies. Our mission was to ideate a platform that could create a massive, distributed workforce to fuel machine learning training and connect researchers with engaged communities.

We received a unique request to conceptualize this project as the “AWS of Workforce,” immediately recognizing Amazon Mechanical Turk (mTurk) as a direct competitor. We delved into the secret recipes of crowd economies, discovering that many researchers, especially in cryptography, have addressed similar challenges, particularly around privacy. While companies require vetted, high-quality workers from platforms, there’s a noticeable lack of innovative solutions to protect workers’ privacy.

## Understanding the Landscape

Our research led us to examine various platforms occupying similar spaces, each with its unique positioning—some focusing on surveys, others on behavioral studies. To carve out a niche for our project, we needed to understand the competitive landscape thoroughly.

**Similar Platforms We Analyzed**

•	**Amazon Mechanical Turk (mTurk)**: [mturk.com](https://www.mturk.com/)

•	**Prolific**: [prolific.co](https://www.prolific.co/)

•	**Appen Crowd**: [appen.com](https://appen.com/)

•	**Clickworker**: [clickworker.com](https://www.clickworker.com/clickworker/)

•	**Microworkers**: [microworkers.com](https://www.microworkers.com/)

•	**Lionbridge AI**: [lionbridge.com](https://www.lionbridge.com/)

•	**CloudResearch**: [cloudresearch.com](https://www.cloudresearch.com/)

•	**TaskRabbit**: [taskrabbit.com](https://www.taskrabbit.com/services)

•	**Wazoku**: [wazoku.com](https://www.wazoku.com/product/open-innovation/)

•	**Wazoku Crowd**: [wazokucrowd.com](https://www.wazokucrowd.com/)

•	**Field Agent**: [fieldagent.net](https://app.fieldagent.net/)

•	**Wonolo**: [wonolo.com](https://www.wonolo.com/)

•	**Pavlovia**: [pavlovia.org](https://pavlovia.org/#main)

We were particularly impressed by the mTurk community’s efforts to support each other through platforms like [mTurk Crowd](https://www.mturkcrowd.com/), which fosters collaboration and shared success among workers.

## Gathering Insights from Researchers

To better understand the needs of potential users, we conducted sample testing within the decentralized science community. We interviewed five participants to gather insights into their requirements. The following summarizes their common desires:

### Common desires among researchers

1.	**Privacy and Data Security**: A universal concern, especially regarding Personally Identifiable Information (PII).

2.	**Affordability**: Budget constraints are significant, particularly in academic and public sectors. Affordable solutions are highly sought after.

3.	**Quality of Data**: While there’s a willingness to trade off quality for affordability, high-quality, reliable data remains a universal desire.

4.	**Participant Recruitment and Retention**: Recruiting and retaining participants is a major challenge. Efficient and effective management of this aspect is crucial.

5.	**Community Engagement**: There’s interest in tapping into community knowledge and participation, whether it’s patient communities in healthcare or citizen scientists in environmental research.

6.	**User Experience**: A seamless and intuitive platform is essential for conducting studies effectively.

7.	**Transparency and Consent**: Adherence to regulations around informed consent is vital, with a desire for more transparent processes.

8.	**Financial Incentives**: While effective for recruitment and retention, financial incentives should not be the sole motivator for participants.

9.	**Ease of Data Collection**: Simplified systems for data collection and analysis are highly valued.

### To Meet Researchers’ Needs

Based on these insights, we proposed a plan aiming to satisfy the majority of researchers:

1.	**Enhanced Privacy Solutions**: Implement advanced encryption and privacy-preserving technologies like zero-knowledge proofs to address data privacy concerns.

2.	**Flexible Pricing Models**: Offer tiered subscription plans or a pay-as-you-go model to accommodate various budgets.

3.	**Data Quality Assurance**: Introduce robust verification methods and quality checks, possibly offering a tiered system of verified and self-claimed participants.

4.	**Improved Recruitment and Retention**: Develop community engagement strategies, potentially harnessing blockchain for incentives and recognition. Utilize machine learning algorithms to match researchers with ideal participants.

5.	**Optimized User Experience**: Invest in UX/UI design to ensure the platform is intuitive and customizable to specific research needs.

6.	**Transparency Tools**: Use blockchain or similar technologies for tracking and managing informed consent, ensuring compliance and building trust.

7.	**Dynamic Incentive Mechanisms**: Offer customizable financial incentives linked to the quality or volume of data contributed.

8.	**Advanced Data Collection and Analysis**: Employ AI and machine learning for efficient data handling, providing valuable insights to researchers.

9.	**Education and Support**: Provide comprehensive support and educational resources to help researchers maximize the platform’s potential.

10.	**Pilot Programs**: Conduct small-scale pilot tests before major feature rollouts to gather user feedback.

By focusing on these elements, we aim to meet the most pressing needs of researchers across disciplines.

## The Challenge of Quality and Inclusivity

While our goal is to create a micro-economy that anyone can participate in, the “secret sauce” lies in the quality output of the workforce. Researchers are willing to pay a fair price for high-quality results. This raises questions:

•	**How do we verify that a worker can produce quality output?**

•	**How can we maintain an inclusive approach that enables everyone to participate?**

### Potential Solutions

•	**UniRep Protocol**: Provides excellent privacy for workers while allowing them to earn and build a reputation without compromising personal data.

•	**State Channels**: Ideal for micropayments, enabling efficient, low-cost transactions between parties.

## Reflecting on Our Journey

Despite the potential, this initiative became more of a research and ideation session. However, we encourage builders interested in creating similar applications to focus on the networking effect between communities and researchers. This connection is a sweet spot for success.

An intriguing idea is to introduce this concept to rural areas, creating a localized micro-economy. By having local officers maintain quality standards, builders can connect workers from rural regions to established research firms. A project we admire is **Karya**, which has made significant strides in this area.

## Final Thoughts and Takeaways

If you’re interested in building a platform within the crowd economy, there’s still ample space for success. Here are some reflections from our journey:

•	**Perceived Value of Blockchain**: People often don’t see the immediate benefits of using blockchain technology. Clear communication of its advantages is essential.

•	**Role of Intermediaries**: Middlemen will often charge substantial fees, which is understandable due to the need for sustainability. Finding ways to minimize costs while maintaining platform viability is crucial.

•	**Demand for Simple Jobs**: There’s a significant appetite for simple tasks. When we launched a microsite ([ivynetwork.cloud](https://ivynetwork.cloud/)), many people signed up to participate.

•	**Identifying and Connecting Opportunities**: There are numerous areas where better connections can lead to success. The key is identifying the specific problems you aim to solve.

## Moving Forward

Our exploration with Ivy Network highlighted the complexities and opportunities in building a decentralized workforce platform. While our journey was more exploratory, we believe that with the right focus on community engagement, privacy, and quality assurance, such a platform can thrive. We invite fellow builders, researchers, and innovators to consider these insights and collaborate towards creating inclusive, efficient, and secure crowd economy solutions.
